# myFlix

## Project Description
The Movie API client uses React to build the client-side for a Single Page Application called myFlix based on its [existing server-side code](https://github.com/kayleebowers/movie-api), which contains a REST API and MongoDB database.

### Key Features
* Users can register and log in to myFlix
* Users can view a list of all movies by visiting the app's homepage
* Users can search for any movie by title in the navigation bar
* Users can access different app views via the navigation bar
* By clicking on the Learn More button, users can see detailed information about a single movie
* Each single movie has similar movies recommended by the matching genre
* Users can add or remove movies from their favorites by clicking on the heart buttons in the movie cards
* Users can view their favorite movies in the profile view
* Users can update their user information in the profile view
* Users can delete their accounts in the profile view
* Users can log out of their accounts

## Getting the Project Running
The application is hosted on Netlify and can be [viewed there](https://myflix22.netlify.app/). 

The application files can also be downloaded and viewed by using the following command in the terminal: `parcel [Path to index.html]`. In this case, you would use the entry point `parcel src/index.html`. If the parcel command is not recognized, add  `npx parcel src/index.html`.
